Test Kimai before executing these commands (they are likely not required in a shared-hosting environment).
You probably need to prefix them with `sudo` and the group might be called different than `www-data`.

Here is an example for Debian/Ubuntu (to be executed inside the Kimai directory):
```bash
chown -R :www-data .
chmod -R g+r .
chmod -R g+rw var/
chmod -R g+rw public/avatars/
```
