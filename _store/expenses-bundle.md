A Kimai 2 plugin, which allows to keep track of your expenses based on customer, project and activity.
These spendings can be categorized and included in your invoices (generated by Kimai).

## Features

- Record all your expenses and show them in a table view
  - The data can be searched- and filtered (see screenshots)  
- All (refundable) expenses will be automatically included in your invoices
- Manage expenses via API
- Import expenses from Kimai 1

Expenses are sorted into free configurable types (categories). Each type has a:
- name 
- visibility flag
- default cost

Each expense has the following fields:
- a date-time 
- category (see above) 
- user 
- project (and customer)
- activity (optional)
- description (free text field)
- the cost (can be hidden for default user, if you use default cost via category)
- an amount (see it as multiplier, use 1 if you want to charge the cost only)
- refundable flag (non-refundable expenses will not be added to your invoices)
- an export flag (to make sure, that each expense is invoiced only once)

## Purchase

## Installation

This plugin is compatible with the following Kimai releases:

| Bundle version    | Kimai 2 version  |
|---                |---               |
| 1.6               | 1.6.2            |
| 1.5               | 1.6.2            |
| 1.4               | 1.6.1            |
| 1.3               | 1.6              |
| 1.2               | 1.4              |
| 1.1               | 1.4              |
| 1.0               | 1.3              |
{: .table }

### Copy the files 

Extract the ZIP file and upload the included directory and all files to your Kimai installation to the new directory:  
`var/plugins/ExpensesBundle/`

The file structure needs to like like this afterwards:

```
var/plugins/
├── ExpensesBundle
│   ├── ExpensesBundle.php
|   └ ... more files and directories follow here ... 
```
### Rebuild the cache

After uploading the files, Kimai needs to know about the new plugin. It will be found, once the cache was re-built:

```
cd kimai2/
bin/console cache:clear --env=prod
bin/console cache:warmup --env=prod
```

### Install the bundle database

Run the following command:

```bash
bin/console kimai:bundle:expenses:install
```

This will install all required databases.

### First test

When logged in as `SUPER_ADMIN`, you will now see the expenses administration screen at `/en/expenses/`.

If this was successful, you can now think about giving permissions to other users as well.

### Setup categories

Before you can start tracking expenses, you will have to create at least one visible category. 
You will be redirected to the category creation screen if Kimai doesn't find one. 

## Permissions

This bundle ships a couple of new permissions, which limit access to certain functionalities:

- `view_expense` - allows access to the expenses screen
- `view_expense_other` -see other users expenses
- `edit_expense` - edit existing expenses
- `edit_expense_cost` - edit the cost of a single expense (can be deactivated for user, when the category has a default cost)
- `create_expense` - create new expenses
- `delete_expense` - delete existing expenses
- `manage_expense_category` - manage expense types 

By default, these are assigned to each user with the role `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`.

{% include alert.html icon="fas fa-exclamation" type="warning" alert="You don't need the following since Kimai 1.6. Please adjust all permission settings in your administration." %}

Read how to assign these permission to your user roles in the [permission documentation](https://www.kimai.org/documentation/permissions.html).

This example is for customers who have a restricted setup and want to provide default costs via the expense types:
```yaml
kimai:
    permissions:
        roles:
            ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN: ['view_expense', 'view_expense_other', 'edit_expense', 'create_expense', 'delete_expense', 'manage_expense_category', 'edit_expense_cost']
            ROLE_ADMIN: ['view_expense', 'view_expense_other', 'edit_expense', 'create_expense', 'delete_expense', 'manage_expense_category', 'edit_expense_cost']
            ROLE_TEAMLEAD: ['view_expense', 'view_expense_other', 'edit_expense', 'create_expense', 'delete_expense']
            ROLE_USER: ['view_expense', 'edit_expense', 'create_expense', 'delete_expense']
```

If you want your user to be able to edit the cost and amount add the `edit_expense_cost` permission to `ROLE_TEAMLEAD` and `ROLE_USER`.
 
After changing the permissions in local.yaml, you need to clear the application cache.

## Updating the plugin

Updating the bundle works the same way as the installation does. 

- Delete the directory `var/plugins/ExpensesBundle/` (to remove deleted files)
- Execute all installation steps again:
  - Copy files
  - Clear cache
  - Update database with `bin/console kimai:bundle:expenses:install`
